Overview
  Welcome to the wiki for the Pythians' Olympics Records website. This wiki is designed to help developers fully understand the website not only from frontend to backend but from all setup to team collaboration.  
However, before we delve into all the details, a proper understanding of the websites motivation is in order.  
These days, more and more people access the internet for much of their daily information and entertainment. However, because of websites' desires to serve their viewers more avenues for content, their layouts and design have become so crowded with links to new information that they become virtually unusable, especially to those inexperienced with technology and the web. This cluttered nature can be seen in many sites out there, specifically sites that deliver information about the Olympics. The Pythians Olympic records website is designed to change that.  

The Pythians website focuses on a sleek and practical design that allows those, even the inexperienced, to find all the information one could want about the medal winning athletes of the Olympics.
